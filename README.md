Functionality brief - 
We have used components, props to pass data from parent to child we have also used various javascript functionalities like map, filter etc. Controlled components is also used in this app,
besides this lifting up state property has also been used that allow us to pass data between sibling componenets.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
